        <p className=''>
            The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCCS) program is a foundational undergraduate degree that provides students with a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and practices. 
            Through a combination of theoretical study and hands-on practical experience, students learn key concepts such as algorithms, programming languages, data structures, software engineering, and computer architecture. 
            The BSCS program equips graduates with the skills needed to design, develop, and implement software solutions for a variety of applications across industries including technology, finance, healthcare, and entertainment. 
            With a strong emphasis on problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical proficiency, graduates of the BSCS program are well-prepared for entry-level positions in the field of computer science or for further study at the graduate level.
