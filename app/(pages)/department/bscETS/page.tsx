        <p className=''>
            The Bachelor of Education (Technology Education) programme is designed to produce competent graduate teachers to teach technical subjects at secondary and post-secondary school levels. 
            Because of the practical nature of the subjects, which will be taught by graduates from this programme, the courses have been designed so that they may be taught with a practical 'hands on' orientation. 
            Considerable time is, therefore, spent in workshops as part of the scheduled teaching. Project work, problem-solving approach and teaching practice in real life learning environments form important components of the programme.
