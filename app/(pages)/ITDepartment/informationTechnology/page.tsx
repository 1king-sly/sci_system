        <p className=''>A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, (abbreviated BSIT or B.Sc. IT), is a bachelor&lsquo;s degree awarded for an undergraduate program in the information technology. The degree is normally required in order to work in the Information technology industry.
            A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc IT) degree program typically takes three to four years depending on the country. This degree is primarily focused on subjects such as software, databases, and networking. In general, computer science degrees tend to focus on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing rather than emphasizing specific technologies.
            The degree is a Bachelor of Science degree with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology and related fields. This degree is awarded for completing a program of study in the field of software development, software testing, software engineering, web design, databases, programming, computer networking and computer systems.
